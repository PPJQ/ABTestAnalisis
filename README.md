# ABTestAnalisis
 You are a data analyst for a large online shop. With the marketing department, you receive a hipotesis list to help increase the store's revenue.

 Thought the analysis we can conclude the following:

 * Group B presented an increase in revenue as well as in the size of orders from the 3rd week of the beginning of the test, this could be due to the fact that in the first two weeks that the information was collected from the emails of the customers from the 3rd week onwards were reflected the results that caused the emails sent to these users.
 * At the beginning of the test the conversion between the groups fluctuated a little giving an advantage to group A, however at the beginning of the second week of the test group B took the lead reaching an almos constant value at the end of the test while group A decresed and like group B stabilized at an almost constant value at the end of the test.
 * There were 50 users with anomalous income and orders, but these were not statistically significant enough to affect the results of the tests.

 According to these results we could conclude that the A/B test of the hyphotesis "Add a subscription form to all home pages. This will help you compile a mailing list", gave a positive result, the test should be stopped and the changes should be made.
